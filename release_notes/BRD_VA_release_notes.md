Client: [Client Name]
Prepared for: [Stakeholder Name/Team]

1. Executive Summary
The purpose of this project is to migrate the existing on-premises applications and infrastructure to Microsoft Azure, leveraging the benefits of scalability, security, and high availability. This migration will improve performance, reduce operational costs, and provide a more flexible environment for growth.

2. Objectives
Migrate on-premises applications and workloads to Azure.
Ensure security and compliance with industry standards.
Optimize costs by using Azure's pay-as-you-go model.
Enable scalability to accommodate future business needs.
Provide training for the IT team on Azure management and operations.

3. Project Scope
In Scope:
Assessment and Planning: Evaluation of current on-premises applications, dependencies, and infrastructure.
Azure Infrastructure Setup: Set up Virtual Networks, Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and necessary resources in Azure.
Migration of Workloads: Migrate databases, applications, and associated services.
Testing and Validation: Ensure that all systems are functioning as expected post-migration.
Training: Provide knowledge transfer sessions to the client’s IT team on Azure best practices.
Out of Scope:
Migration of applications not identified during the assessment phase.
Modifications to existing applications during the migration process.

4. Business Requirements
4.1 Functional Requirements:
Azure Resource Provisioning: Create and configure Azure resources such as Virtual Machines, Azure SQL Database, Blob Storage, and Networking configurations (VNets, Subnets).
Data Migration: Migrate data from on-premises storage to Azure Blob Storage or Azure Files.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement Azure Monitor for real-time monitoring of resources and Azure Log Analytics for tracking logs.
Backup and Disaster Recovery: Set up Azure Backup and Azure Site Recovery for disaster recovery purposes.
4.2 Non-Functional Requirements:
Security: Ensure all Azure resources are compliant with the client’s security policies.
Scalability: Applications should scale seamlessly in Azure based on user demand.
Availability: High availability for all critical applications, with at least 99.9% uptime.
Performance: Applications must meet the agreed-upon response time benchmarks.

5. Assumptions
The client’s on-premises environment is compatible with Azure services.
All necessary internal approvals for migration will be obtained before the project start date.
The client’s IT team will assist in the migration, especially for testing and validation purposes.

6. Constraints
Time: The migration must be completed within the next 3 months.
Budget: The migration should not exceed $500,000.
